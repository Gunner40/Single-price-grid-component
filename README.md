## Overview

My task was to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder and get it looking as close to the designs as possible. Margins and padding etc were matched as closely as possible with the design.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action
